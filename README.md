# Distributed System Project

This project is a distributed system with core functionalities implemented for distributed file management, failure detection, and distributed search (grep). The system is designed to handle file transfers, monitor system health, and process data across multiple nodes, providing scalability and fault tolerance.

## Project Overview

This distributed system project includes three main components:
1. **File System Module (`file_system`)**: Supports distributed file storage and transfer across nodes.
2. **Distributed Grep Module (`grep`)**: Enables searching for patterns across files distributed across the network.
3. **Failure Detection Module (`failure_detection`)**: Monitors the system, detecting node failures and ensuring system resilience.

Each module is independent but can work in concert within a distributed system, ensuring data accessibility, system reliability, and efficient search capabilities across nodes.
